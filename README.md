## Demonstates:

- Raising states
- Leveraging redux with polymer
- Mixins for sharing actions, auto starting/stopping sagas
- Immutable which causes rerenders for only things that changed
- Side effects with redux-saga
- shadow dom
- css variables
- Babel is not requried for a modern web application
